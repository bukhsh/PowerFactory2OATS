# PowerFactory2OATS
A collection of Python scripts that can convert a network data from DIgSILENT PowerFactory into a spreadsheet (a readable data format for optimisation and analysis toolbox for power systems (OATS): a software developed at The University of Strathclyde). Note that a access to DIgSILENT PowerFactory is required to perform this conversion.

## Using this filter
The top level script is 'run_file_PF.py'. This script needs to run inside DIgSILENT PowerFactory. Number of 'csv' files will be produced after this script is successfully executed. The csv files containts information about the network e.g. chracteristics of branches and generators.

The script 'run_file_writexlsx.py' can be used to convert the csv files into a spreadsheet.
